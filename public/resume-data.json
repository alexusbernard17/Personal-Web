      "description": "I'm currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My threads are Intelligence and Information Internetworks. I have experience in working as a full-stack developer and I also enjoy building mobile applications. I am proficient in multiple object-oriented languages, however Java has been my favorite one so far. I am also familiar and have worked on several front-end and back-end frameworks/ libraries. Outside of school, I often play basketball with my friends, and I mostly spend my free time watching and following the NFL and NBA. I am a huge fan of the Seahawks and LeBron James, and yes he is the GOAT. Thanks for checking out my page, and please do not hesitate to contact me!",
