      "description": "I'm currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My threads are Intelligence and Information Internetworks. I have experience in working as a full-stack developer and I also enjoy building mobile applications. I am proficient in multiple object-oriented languages, however Java has been my favorite one so far. I am also familiar with and have worked on several front-end and back-end frameworks/ libraries. Outside of school, I often play basketball with my friends, and I mostly spend my free time watching the NFL and NBA. I am a huge fan of the Seahawks and LeBron James. Thanks for checking out my page, and please feel free to contact me!",

We created a computer vision machine learning model using the Microsoft Azure Computer Vision Toolkit and trained it with the Freiburg Groceries Dataset to determine whether a product is in stock or out of stock. This was a project submission for the NCRâ€™s 2022 Global Hackathon and we placed in the top 10 for the software division.",
